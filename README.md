## 👋 Hi, I'm Aditi!

Biomedical Engineering grad student at Columbia with a background in cancer research, computational biology, and biotech.

🔨 **What drives me:** Building things that actually work for real people. I get a lot of ideas for making everyday tools better and wonder why they haven't been implemented yet - so I'm learning to build them myself.

🎯 **Coding focus:** Shift towards user-friendly applications, privacy-first solutions, tools that enhance daily life

🤝 **Open to collaborate on:** Projects that solve real problems, improve existing tools, or make technology more accessible and privacy-respecting
